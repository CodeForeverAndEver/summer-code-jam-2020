## Introduction
We call it the RSSit app. It is a platform to post fun stuff, make virtual communities, and interact (chat) with your community members. We also have added a rss feed for all the content i.e the posts by the users. This helps to generate a rss feed for the users and helpful to integrate in a rss feed reader.


Some features include:

- Messaging functionality that allows you to connect and communicate with fellow community members.
- Creation of new posts, communities.
- Update your User Profile
- Add Comments to the Posts
- View Top Posts (based on max views), Top Communities (based on max subscribers)
