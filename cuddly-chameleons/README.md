## About our project
Our project is simple blog/news site, that implement basic things, like creating, editing, deleting in frontend.

## Setting up and running
### Django and PostgreSQL
Simplest thing ever (when you have Docker and Docker Compose installed):
```
docker-compose up
```
Django admin is at `localhost:8000/admin` and default admin username is `admin` and password too `admin`

### React
Open new console window. Go to `retro_news` directory, and there run following commands:
```
npm install
```
then, to start:
```
npm start
```
After these steps, you can visit site at `localhost:3000`.
Default superuser (only superusers can create posts) username is `admin` and password too `admin`.
