# **Hypnotic Hedgehogs** present *A Brief History of the Internet*

### Time sure flies...

...and the nineties internet is now 30 years old - which means many current Internet users didn't experience the glory of the dial-up age! Our project aims to mimic the experience (and provide some of the nostalgia) of the early Internet. 

### FILL

#### Required utilities:
Our project is containerised with Docker -- thus the user must have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed in the environment. 

#### Running the application:
1. Navigate to the ```hypnotic-hedgehogs``` directory.
2. Run the ``docker-compose up -d``` command in your terminal.

The project should be accessible through your browser, at ```localhost:8000``` (where ```localhost``` is usually ```127.0.0.1:8000```).
