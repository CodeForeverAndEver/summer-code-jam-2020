# Early morning internet (Melodic Manatees)
Welcome to early morning internet, an app that lets you kick start your day!

Tired of having the monotonous homepages that greet you at the start of your day? Our website plans to change that. We use the power of Django and the look of Bulma to provide features that allow you to customize your experience and quickly note ideas.

Some features include:

1. User specific profiles that let you tailor your experience.

2. Custom backgrounds, profile pics and feed preferences.

3. A diary to enter your ideas, with a word cloud feature that highlights frequently occurring topics.

4. Clean look and ease of access to features powered by Bulma, an opensource framework based on on Flexbox.
