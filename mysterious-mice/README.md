This is the default README of your team's project. Please replace this by a README with more information on your project. At the very least, your README should contain information on how to set-up and run your project.

# Running Spacebook
## Docker-Compose
Run `docker-compose build` to build the Docker image.

Run `docker-compose up -d` to build, create, start and attach the container. The `d` runs the container in the background.
