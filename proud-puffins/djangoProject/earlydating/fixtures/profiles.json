I look for substance and i find this site\\nis an utter waste of time for both sexes, i know a lot of female\\nfriends on this site that get inundated (oooh sat word) with emails\\nfrom a ton of guys, so that makes it difficult and miserable for\\nyou. I'm throwing you the ball to see what you do, don't worry i'll\\nstill open the door, take you out to dinner and pull your hair in\\nbed whenever necessary. If i run into you in the real world i'll do\\nthe approaching. I think questions and essays don't do justice,\\nchemistry can only be experienced in person.\\n\\nabout me:\\na polymath is a person whose expertise spans a significant number\\nof different subject areas. I strive for this since i believe\\ngrowing as a person is very important. I like to be happy and enjoy\\nlife. I take my time trying to do the things that make me relaxed,\\nmake me content and make me laugh; life's too short.\\ni'm looking for friends/activity partners first and then seeing\\nwhere things go.\\n\\ni'm a lot less serious than i seem, i'm not a jock/meat-head, and\\ni'm not arrogant but am confident. I'm pretty humble if you get to\\nknow me, i just have a huge drive to move forward.\\n\\ni'm sexual, but i'm pretty complex in the other dimensions of my\\nlife too. I like all types of fun activities, i like poetry slams\\nand classical & foreign music, along with hip-hop and dub-step.\\ni like trying out new things, if you have something fun you that\\nyou do, and want to teach me, you get points.\\n\\ni'm a consultant and fly back and forth between nyc and san\\nfrancisco for work. I moved to california almost 5 years ago from\\nnyc, i was trying to escape the concrete jungle of ny (though i\\nlove it there) to explore new lands.\\n\\ni moved here to be in silicon valley, having studied computer\\nscience, and now i'm a sr. Software engineer in hopes of becoming a\\ntech entrepreneur. This is a goal i'm working towards with a master\\nplan behind it's not just about getting rich, i can't be a\\nphilanthropist without being an entrepreneur first.\\n\\nhaving a job that has me sit in-front of a computer all day, makes\\nme take out my energy by doing other things, like hiking, running,\\nbiking, snowboarding and anything that is outdoors and keeps me\\nfit. Although there are lots of indoor things i enjoy doing like\\ngoing to restaurants, shows, movies, playing board games with\\nfriends, cooking, listening to music and dancing, drinking beer or\\nwine, going out dancing, latin music is fun sometimes.

Even if i think i know the\\nanswers, one thing i'm sure of, who i am and what i want is never\\nset in stone. Those answers continue to evolve; which i'm sure is a\\ngood thing. Having said that...i know for sure that i'm a gay white\\nmale living in sf for the past 26 years and self-employed in a\\nprofession that i really enjoy. Being creative and getting paid for\\nit is pretty cool. I like where i live and usually love the people\\nthat surround me, sometimes not, you know we all have our moods. I\\nalso know that i'd like to meet a decent, honest, caring and\\npassionate guy that i can count on to ride with me through this\\ncrazy world. Generally speaking though, you'll probably find me to\\nbe a very easy going, fun guy with a lot of interests, very honest,\\na lot of passion and a really good heart and soul. I'm a pretty\\nplayful guy, i like men who can be boyish in that way, knowing when\\nto be serious and when to let loose and have fun being a kid. I\\ntend to be attracted to guys who are more on the active side in and\\nout of the sack, guys who are comfortable hiking, biking, being in\\nthe ocean, basically moving your body, not interested in couch\\ndwellers. In addition, emotionally available guys are where it's at\\nfor me. If you can communicate with me, that's a big plus, we're\\nhalf way there. I'm not into drama, save it for the stage. Like\\neveryone, i have my faults and i'll be the first to admit\\nit...perfection is completely overrated. I'm authentic and real and\\nunderstanding, but i do have a very low tolerance for people who\\naren't. Physically, emotionally and spiritually, i take care of\\nmyself and invest time and energy into those parts of myself and\\ni'm drawn to people who do the same. I like to be active, but not\\nscheduled out, i need my down time. I enjoy being outdoors and\\nbeing social but also like to hang out alone at home or just take a\\nwalk on the beach by myself to recharge. I get a lot of comfort and\\npleasure from the ocean. When i surf, i find it so amazing to be in\\nthe water, surrounded by sea life and viewing the coast from out\\nthere. Riding a wave is an incredible feeling, being powered by\\nnature and feeling so in sync with life, so much a part of nature.\\nthat's my deeper side talking.\\nmost of my friends have been with me for years, some as long as\\ngrade school. I'm really loyal that way. It's very comforting to\\nhave a long history with people, helps to ground me.\\nmy family is really cool and wants to see me with a nice guy that\\nthey can embarrass me in front of. Isn't that what families are\\nfor, to remind us of where we came from and how far we've\\nevolved...hopefully. My mom is really great, she's 83 and is so\\nactive, doing yoga and aerobics, taking trips, drinking boxed wine\\nwith friends, volunteering, keeping the family together and\\ndrinking more boxed wine with friends. We're big fans of each\\nother. I have a large extended family, aunts, uncles, cousins and\\nwe get together usually once a year at thanksgiving. They always\\nget excited when i bring a new guy around. You know the gay\\nrelative with a new boyfriend is a novelty in most families. I\\nthink it makes them feel hip and cool and that works for me.\\non the serious side, i'm hiv- if that matters to you one way or the\\nother.\\nwell enough about me. I hope i've given you some insight into who i\\nam and the type of man i'm looking to meet; besides, i'm tired of\\nwriting about myself. So if you're interested let me know, give me\\na wink or whatever the hell it is they do on this site to\\ncommunicate an interest.\\nhope you find what you're looking for.

Low\\nemissions.\\n\\nyesterday i wrote a nerdy joke:\\nq: what did the index card who was born at 4:59pm say at noon on\\nhis third birthday?\\na: \\\"i'll be 3 by 5!\\\"\\nthanks. I'll be here all week.\\n\\ni grew up in upstate ny, so i have somewhat rural sensibilities.\\nyou might find me a bit guarded at first. Fair warning: you can't\\nread me. But, i'm soft and gooey on the inside, and affectionate by\\nnature. I only give genuine hugs (none of that a-frame rubbish). I\\nlove palindromes. I'm kind of paranoid about douche-baggery, but i\\nwill ride a motorcycle if it gets me in the carpool lane, or wear\\nshades if it's reeeeeally bright out (but i will never call a\\nperson \\\"bro\\\", call snow \\\"powder\\\", or be glad to be passing through\\nthe marina district).\\n\\ni'm a hard worker, perfectionist in limited respects, but my\\nattitude is generally laid back and down to earth. I like to make\\nmyself a better man, but i'm far from type-a, and i don't have a\\ncompetitive bone in my body. Generally i prefer to do things for my\\ndamn-self if i can learn how, so i have an eclectic skill\\nset.\\n\\nmy sense of humor is hyperactive. Anything from south park\\nslap-stick to the mega-subtle dance scene in pride and prejudice\\nmakes me laugh. Ive got bags of humility; if you can't make fun of\\nyourself, you're missing out on 87.3% of the fun in the\\nuniverse.\\n\\ni'm the type of nerd who doesn't do much nerd stuff, but a full 20%\\nof what i say will make no sense because it's a reference to a\\nmovie from 20 years ago that nobody has seen except for me. I like\\nto walk, hike, run, bike, swim (preferably in chlorinated water),\\nand most anything designed to systematically tucker me out (and\\noffset my voracious appetite for sugar -- diabetes here i come). I\\nlike to play volleyball and tennis, even though i suck at them. I\\nlove tons of music, though rarely more than one song from any given\\nartist. I also love tons of movies that have nothing to do with\\neach other (except maybe kevin bacon).\\n\\ni have a boyfriend. You'd like him, he's adorable.

			"bio" : "I guess i'll appeal to two stereotypes that come close to\\ndescribing me. I'm often described as a \\\"nice guy\\\" and a\\n\\\"geek\\\".\\n\\nas you might expect, i do use computers a lot, and i enjoy math and science. I'm also fascinated with\\nlanguages,\\nspecifically how they change over time to form dialects, and then\\nfurther to become distinct languages. Since i know spanish pretty well, i mostly pay\\nattention to the romance languages, since it's easier for me to see\\nhow words in the different languages are related to one\\nanother.\\n\\neating well makes me feel good about myself, and i try to stick to\\nhealthy food, but i also loooove junk food. Think tina fey in 30\\nrock. If you claim to eat only healthy food, i *dare* you to go to\\nfive guys and\\ntell me you don't like it. I mean, come on now, you can't deny that\\nstuff is delicious!\\n\\nsometimes, i try to pick up less geeky hobbies. Dancing is one, but\\ni've found i'm just not able to do club dancing: it's just too hard\\nto let loose and not worry about what other people are thinking. So\\nabout 5 years ago, i started taking classes in dances with more\\nstructure. I started with salsa, then moved on to waltz, polka, and\\nsuch. But quickly i found the dance that truly matched me:\\nswing.\\n\\nit's kind of funny to me how each dance has an associated\\npersonality. Salsa is all about girls dressing sexy and guys acting\\nlike suave...well, predators. Waltz is all about acting elegant and\\ngraceful. But swing is about being fun, happy, and maybe a little\\nwacky. I like to think that describes me. And even if it doesn't,\\nat least i enjoy *pretending* that it does.\\n\\nas the sidebar indicates, i'm quite serious about my atheism. But\\nthat doesn't mean i have 100% certainty, or that i get in people's\\nfaces about it. I'm more like 99.999% certain, willing to change my\\nmind if the right evidence is presented (though pretty darn\\nconfident such evidence will never be presented!). And i subscribe\\nto the \\\"don't be a d***\\\" philosophy. I may ridicule prominent\\ncreationists in private, but if asked by a religious person about\\nmy beliefs, i'll be honest and polite.",

When i\\nfirst came out here, i was seeing what silicon valley was like,\\ncommuting to south bay, etc. I left that job a year ago and was\\nfreelancing in sf for a while. It was a great time - lots of coffee\\nshops, plenty of sleep, chores all got done, lots of biking, took\\nup a lot of random hobbies, cooked dinner again. Now i'm working at\\na startup in the city, trying to find ways to keep some of the\\nthings i got out of the freelance life while still working a job\\nwhere i'm learning a ton.\\n\\ni've become a fan of backpacking in the sierras (i like the rocky\\ndry landscapes, not so much the coastal stuff like big basin). I go\\nrunning around dolores park occasionally. I love drinking tea. I\\nrecently gave up on resisting drinking coffee, which i have mixed\\nfeelings about. But i bought a french press because i like the\\nprocess of making it. I love eating well and don't mind investing\\nin that part of my life at all. I can lose myself in work that i'm\\nexcited about. And it's important to me that i be around people i\\nadmire who make me a better person.",

Most of the time i'm\\nvery good at this.\\n\\ni love theater, games (board, card), traveling, intelligence,\\nexcellent food, indie films, poker, backgammon, and things too\\nnumerous to list. By day i'm a computer professional with a talent\\nfor both breaking things and keeping them from breaking. In my\\nspare time, i play a fair bit of poker and study the game. I used\\nto play professionally, but it's a really rough way to make an easy\\nliving. Plus, i learned that seeking out stupid people and\\nsurrounding myself with them wasn't all that much fun.\\n\\ni'm also an avid photographer, and i shoot a fair bit of bondage as\\nwell as a lot of g-rated stuff. In the last few years i've\\nexhibited my work in galleries across the us. I've almost reached\\nthe point where i can say \\\"nationally-exhibited photographer\\\" with\\na straight face.\\n\\ndid i mention theater and travel? i have 50 quid and a london tube\\ncard in my wallet right now, and a permanent london cell phone\\nnumber. The last time i was in london, three different people\\nstopped me on the street to ask for directions, and i was able to\\ngive correct answers to each of them.\\n\\noh, i mentioned poly and kinky. I'm polyamorous, and in a\\nrelationship with someone. Like most things in my life it's an\\nunusual situation. My dating dance card is full, though i'm always\\ninterested in making new friends. I might also be in the market for\\na bdsm playpartner, an sm bottom or switch.\\n\\ni like to cuddle, and i like to have interesting conversations. The\\nidea of staying up most of the night cuddling and talking and\\nfooling around is particularly appealing to me.\\n\\ni'm also kinky, and i've been involved in the leather/bdsm\\ncommunity on and off for almost two decades. I don't necessarily\\nneed that in a partner, but they need to be able to cope with that\\npart of me. On the other hand, someone who thinks that missionary\\nwith the lights out is the be-all and end-all probably wouldn't be\\nhappy with me.\\n\\nand, in case you didn't notice, i have flaming fuchsia hair. No,\\nreally! (although i don't usually scowl nearly as much as my photo\\nmight indicate. :).\\n\\ni am quirky, intelligent, and sarcastic",

I hail from the embarrassing state\\nof arizona. (if you don't know what i mean, this article will catch\\nyou up:\\nhttp://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/24/total-eclipse/.)\\narizona lays claim to some wonderful people and phenomenal sunsets\\n... But i knew, even as a child, that it was not the state for\\nme.\\n\\nfifteen years after my prescient declaration, i drove my car\\nfourteen hours west, with a friend driving my belongings in a\\nu-haul truck behind me. As we crossed the bay bridge*, i cried,\\nreflecting on how long i'd wished to live here, and hardly\\nbelieving that my residency launch date had arrived. I have been in\\nlove with this city every day of the thirteen years since.\\n\\n*the golden gate bridge would have made this story far more\\nromantic.\\n\\nbetween the article i cited and my san francisco love story, you\\nknow my politics. I am fixed on that side, and i sit at the edge\\nfarthest from the aisle. If i ever land on a particular spiritual\\npath, i'll let you know; i am more inquisitive and open-minded on\\nthat one.\\n\\nthe overused term \\\"intellectually curious\\\" describes me. I am also\\nemotional, and my sensitivity extends to others in the form of\\ncompassion. If you know astrology, i am an aquarius with a scorpio\\nmoon and libra rising. On myers-briggs, i'm an enfj. Facebook says\\nthe downton abbey character i personify is lady sybil.\\n\\ni love dancing, running, and singing along to my ipod. If you need\\nan aggressive sweeper on your soccer team, look no further: i\\nhaven't kicked a ball in years, but when i played in an indoor\\nsoccer league with several european men, the other side almost\\nnever got past me. I'm not that great at strategy or aim, but i was\\nthe last defensive line on a goalie-free court, and i couldn't\\nstand letting the team down. So i rarely did.\\n\\ni seek a partner who is funny, kind, smart, and good to the core -\\na trait that overlaps with kind, but speaks more to character,\\nwhich is important to me. As a partner, i am loyal, honest,\\ntrusting, and independent. I love talking for hours, and i am\\nhighly social. I also need a fair amount of alone time, and i know\\nhow to ask for it. I am affectionate, funny, and thoughtful. I like\\nmen who are, too.",

I was walking up the hill\\nto alamo sq park from my new apartment. It's this beautiful park at\\nthe very top of a hill, surrounded by beautiful victorians, with a\\nview of much of the city. Big, windswept cypress trees grow there, and there's a shoe\\ngarden and a place for dogs to play. There was this moment, at\\nalmost 6pm, when the sun was just thinking about setting for the\\nevening, and the fog was meandering in over the sunset, and a\\nmission bell was ringing in the distance, where the wind caught my\\nhair and i felt like i was exactly where i should be, in that\\nmoment.

I'd\\nlike to at least have one or two email conversations first before\\nchatting, but i'd be happy to chat after that.\\n\\ndisclaimer 2: i'm a little weird around the edges. I'm kind of an\\nurban witch, i have a cauldron and an altar, i sometimes howl at\\nthe moon, but i'm also super modern and practical. I like computers\\nand high heels and hiking and meteor showers. I like shoe polish\\nand i also like mud and i like my men that way too.\\n\\ndisclaimer 3: i'm kind of an old soul who has learned how live in\\nthe now and be more childlike.

Perhaps it is more accurate to say that as a human\\nbeing i am interested in nothing, but as a journalist i need to\\nshow interest in everything so as to be able to effectively\\nresearch the topics i'm writing about. This is probably why i like\\nbeing a journalist, because if i wasn't a journalist i would be\\nnothing. Without journalism, i would have no purpose, no reason to\\nspeak to anyone, no reason to be curious. So i guess i will\\ncontinue being a journalist until i decide to give up, which will\\nprobably be never!\\n\\ni don't drink, smoke, or take drugs that haven't been prescribed to\\nme by a medical professional. I have tried drinking! it was awful.\\ni have been told that alcohol is an acquired taste. Well, if this\\nthing is expensive and tastes bad and does terrible things to your\\nbody, why would you want to acquire a taste for it? we're not\\ntalking about brussel sprouts here, people.\\n\\ni try to lead a very healthy lifestyle because why the hell not?\\nhere i am, existing, 23-years-old with no debilitating medical\\ncondition ... Why wouldn't i want to be the best person i could\\npossibly be? i don't eat carbs (except for one day a week to shock\\nmy metabolism) and have no tolerance for soft drinks (the bubbles\\nhurt my tongue). I really enjoy green tea and garlic. Lentils are\\nmy favourite legume.\\n\\ni find most things boring. I don't enjoy talking about music or\\nfilms or videogames or anything that doesn't relate to journalism.\\ni am incredibly single-minded (but not narrow-minded). I enjoy\\npainting. I used to enjoy playing the violin until i switched to a\\nnew one that doesn't fine tune the strings, and now tuning the\\ninstrument has become incredibly tedious.",
