(i also don't take myself too seriously, more on that in\na minute).\nthat said, i have tons of friends. what i am seeking is intentional\nintimacy, really hot sex and consistency. expect to converse with\nme a bit before we meet up. i am super busy, and you are going to\nhave to inspire me a bit to get my attention. i am super generous\nwith my attention once you have it though :)\nmy ideal relationship (at the moment) would be with someone who\nwants to go deep and is willing to commit time and energy to do\nthat on a weekly basis. i would love to have one night each week be\nreserved for getting together, making dinner, gazing deeply into\neach others eyes, being present and yummy and cuddly and sweet and\nhaving extraordinarily great sex. (i am sure i can live up to my\nhalf of that bargain!). every other weekend i would like to do\nsomething social and or adventurous. go to festivals, harbin hot\nsprings, some awesome fun sexy party (i go to a lot of those!) or\nadventure off to some new experience...and see how many weird\nplaces we can have sex along the way!\ni want a relationship that is both really deep, and really\nspacious.\ni have a lot going on in my life, and i want to have partnership\nand intimacy, and...ease of scheduling. i am wickedly practical\nabout scheduling my fun time. it is a priority. i want to organize\nyou into my optimal reality, and get things dialed...so we can just\nrelax and have the best time ever when we are together. i feel like\nhalf of dating is figuring how and when to have the date. let's\njust be organized about it. free up some energy for more yum!\ni am the goofiest goddess you will ever meet. promise. i spend a\nlot of time with small children. i have an excellent perspective on\nlife. so much so, that i am a life optimization consultant. i\nprofessionally help people have more fun in life. so trust me, this\nis a good plan ;)\na few important notes for those that might experience these as deal\nbreakers.\n1. i am not making people in my body. i am free of that karma in\nthis body in this lifetime. i love children. i have a 20 year\ncareer working with children. children are priority in my life. i\njust don't need to make one.\n2. i am totally committed to polyamory. i define that as massively\ndifferent than polyf**kery. i would be happy to explain the\ndifference. i have an infinite amount of love to share, and i want\nto play with people that support me in sharing it. i believe in\nmonogamy when creating a relationship, (it is already complicated,\nlet's not make it more so.) let's get rock solid, and figure out\nwhat is the most fun for us. respect, communication and creating an\noptimal environment for learning, growing and expanding are my\noutcomes in relating. i am a free, and considerate person. those\nare not mutually exclusive. try me, i bet i will inspire you.\n3. i experience relating (in any time frame) as an opportunity for\npersonal evolution. i seek to play with people who understand what\nthat means, and who are on that ride.\n4. you don't need to plan on marrying me. i am already happily\nmarried to myself. i am happy to share my abundant and joyous life\nwith you. all you have to do is wake up next to me and think. \"i am\nthe luckiest person in the world.\" as long as that is how we feel.\nwe win.\ni don't know what \"term\" of dating (long/short) this means. it is\nall fairly relative. if you are an amazing person who knows it, and\ncan rock my world in 24 hours, i certainly don't want to miss the\nopportunity to experience that. i am also, as i have said, super\nbusy, so it is likely that my attention will be prioritized towards\nthose looking for something a little bit more stable and long term.\ni want to go big with you. either way, when you write to me, offer\nme what inspires you.\nfunny will make me chuckle, but it probably won't get you into my\npants. it is ok if you want that, and a 2 line email is not going\nto get you there. so take a minute to rock my world with your\nwordsmithing. i will be sure to return the favor ;) i find spell\ncheck really sexy. i find sesquipedalian communication interesting.\nif you send me an email using \"text language\" i will ignore you."
