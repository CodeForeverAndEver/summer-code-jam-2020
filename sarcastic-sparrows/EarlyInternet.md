# Early Internet

- When I think early internet, I think of awful, but charming, GeoCities pages. We could potentially do something along those lines.

    - A randomized GeoCities page generator would be cool. 

    - Replicating existing websites is a common practice exercise for learning web frameworks, we might try to replicate or serve content from an existing site in the style of a bulletin board or GeoCities-style page.

- It'd be cool to create an interactive visualization or a set of interactive visualizations to show the history of the internet - how we progressed from a few machines connected via NPL / ARPA net to what we have today. Would involve some fun research and seems like our group has some data / graphics backgrounds.

- We also seem to have a few business / economic folks in the audience, so I think it might also be cool to do something data-focused with the dot com bubble.
