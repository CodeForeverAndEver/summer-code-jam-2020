# Overview

**SpydirWeb** has three different types of pages: information pages, blog pages, and business pages. The blog and business pages use [openai's gpt-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) AI to generate the content, while the info pages use the [wikipedia](https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/) package. Images are gotten using the [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/).

Click one of the three links listed on the home page to get started browsing Spydirweb.

The text in the blog and business pages may take a while to load, as they are generated with an AI.

# Installation

For the judges, please check the `#talented-tigers` channel on the discord server.
Copy and paste the text block we sent into a file called `.env` in the `talented-tigers` directory.

For non-judges you'll need your own API key for Pixabay, which SpydirWeb use for collecting images. Go to [their website](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) to get a key and then make a new file called `.env` with only 
```
API_KEY=your_key_here
```
written inside of it.
