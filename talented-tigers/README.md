### Overview

**SpydirWeb** has three different types of pages: information pages, blog pages, and business pages. The blog and business pages use [Openai's gpt-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) AI to generate the content, while the info pages use the [wikipedia](https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/) package. Images are retrieved using the [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/).

Click one of the three links listed on the home page to get started browsing Spydirweb.

The text in the blog and business pages may take a while to load, as they are generated with an AI.
